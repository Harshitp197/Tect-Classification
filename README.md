## Text Classification with PDF and Webpage Data

# This repository provides a Python-based text classification system capable of handling both PDF documents and web pages. The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to categorize text data into predefined categories.

# Features

Text Extraction: Extract text from PDF files and web pages.
Text Preprocessing: Normalize, tokenize, and remove stopwords from the text.
Dataset Creation: Build a dataset from PDFs organized into subdirectories by category.
Model Training: Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using TF-IDF features.
Classification: Classify new PDF documents or web page content into one of the predefined categories.
Batch Classification: Support for classifying multiple documents or URLs in one run.
Results Storage: Save classification results to a CSV file for further analysis.
